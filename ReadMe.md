## **📖 About This Repository**
This repository contains my solutions to problems from **Competitive Programming 4 (CP4)** and various online judges such as:
- **UVA Online Judge**
- **Kattis**
- **LeetCode**
- **Codeforces**
- **AtCoder**
- **Google Kick Start & Code Jam**

Each problem is solved using efficient **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, covering concepts like:
✅ Dynamic Programming  
✅ Graph Algorithms  
✅ Greedy Methods  
✅ Divide & Conquer  
✅ Number Theory  
✅ Combinatorics & More!

## **🛠️ Setup & Usage**
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
To get started, clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhildhiman7/cp4.git
cd cp4
```

### **2️⃣ Compile & Run a Problem**
Each problem has its own `.cpp` file. You can compile and run a specific solution like this:
